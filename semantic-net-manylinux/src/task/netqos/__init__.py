"""Initialization for the network QoS prediction task.

This package contains modules for models, data preprocessing and
metrics related to predicting network quality of service (QoS) such as
throughput, latency and packet loss.  The main entry point for other
parts of the system is the ``model.build_model`` function and
``preprocess.get_dataloaders``.
