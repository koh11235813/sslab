"""Adâ€‘hoc UDP transport implementation.

This module implements a minimal UDP transport class for sending and
receiving byte payloads.  It is intended for experimentation and
demonstration rather than production use; features such as
retransmissions, congestion control and security are not provided.
Nevertheless, this provides a starting point for testing the semantic
communication pipeline over a custom network topology.
